## Introduction

Precompiled contracts are specialized smart contracts implemented directly in the execution layer of a blockchain. Unlike user-deployed smart contracts that execute EVM bytecode, precompiled contracts offer optimized native implementations for complex cryptographic and computational operations. This significantly improves efficiency and reduces gas costs. Precompiled contracts exist at fixed addresses within the execution client and each precompile has a predefined gas cost based on its computational complexity, ensuring predictable execution fees.

Story Protocol introduces two precompiled contracts:

- `p256Verify` precompile to support signature verifications in the secp256r1 elliptic curve.
- `ipgraph` precompile to enhance on-chain intellectual property management.

In addition, Story Protocol’s execution layer supports all standard EVM precompiled contracts, ensuring full compatibility with Ethereum-based tooling and applications.

## p256Verify precompile

Refer to [RIP-7212](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md) for more information.

## IPgraph precompile

The `ipgraph` precompile enables efficient querying and modification of IP relationships and royalty structures while minimizing gas costs.

This precompile provides multiple functions based on the function selector—the first 4 bytes of the input.
