---

This page provides information on the story execution and consensus client software release information. You may find execution client releases in [story-geth](https://github.com/piplabs/story-geth/releases) repo, and consensus client releases in [story](https://github.com/piplabs/story/releases) repo.

### Production releases

There are generally four types of releases:

- Major: It requires hardfork upgrade with a predefined upgrade height. Node operators need to upgrade before or on the height. The release will increase minor version number.
- Minor: It doesn't require hardfork upgrade. Node operators are required to upgrade binaries as soon as possible. The release will increase patch version number.
- Fix: It is an urgent fix. Node operators are required to upgrade binaries as soon as possible. The release will increase minor version or patch version number.
- Optional: It is an optional fix. Node operators can upgrade binaries based on needs. The release will increase patch version number.

Each release comes with a release note describing a list of new features or fixes. Released software binaries are also attached in the release note. We currently provide binaries supporting four types of systems: darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64, linux-amd64, and linux-arm64. You may also build your binaries using the commit hash in the release note.
