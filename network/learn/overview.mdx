**Story** is a purpose-built decentralized blockchain supercharged by a *multi-core* execution environment. 
Its architecture comprises a main execution core alongside multiple highly customized cores. The main core provides EVM equivalence, enabling rapid adoption of existing applications from the ecosystem. 
The Intellectual Property (IP) core, one of the specialized cores, efficiently handles intellectual property registration as a native asset class while optimizing operations across complex IP relationship graphs. This core transforms intelligence into programmable IP assets. Although Story focuses primarily on intellectual property, its flexible architecture enables the adoption of future cores that can expand far beyond IP-related applications.

For details on implementation, see the [Node Software](/network/learn/node-software) chapter.
