The **Consensus Layer (CL)** is built on the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT. The Cosmos SDK provides a modular framework for building blockchain applications, enabling seamless integration of new modules and features while allowing the network to be easily extended and customized. `story` client introduces upgrades and additional Cosmos SDK modules to support Engine API integration and novel staking mechanisms. CometBFT, a high-performance, scalable, and secure consensus engine, has been extensively tested within the Cosmos ecosystem. CometBFT and Cosmos SDK communicate through ABCI++ interface(link to ABCI++ spec). Checkout [story](https://github.com/piplabs/story) repo to review the codes.
