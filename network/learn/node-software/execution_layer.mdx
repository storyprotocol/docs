The **Execution Layer (EL)** is a fork of the Geth client, with the addition of the [IPGraph Precompile](/network/node-architecture/precompile) and [RIP-7212](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md) precompile. It handles transaction execution, broadcasting and state storage while maintaining full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and supporting all Ethereum JSON-RPC methods. Currently we support all features introduced by the Pectra upgrade. Checkout [story-geth](https://github.com/piplabs/story-geth) repo to review the codes.
