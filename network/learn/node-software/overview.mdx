Story's node client software has been implemented to support full EVM equivalency and fast block time and one-shot finality.

Story's node software consists of two components: an [Execution Layer (EL)](/network/learn/node-software/execution_layer) responsible for the execution environment and a [ Consensus Layer (CL)](/network/learn/node-software/consensus_layer) responsible for the consensus and block formation. 

These two layers communicate via the [Engine API](/network/learn/node-software/engine-api) presented [Here](https://hackmd.io/@danielrachi/engine_api).
