## Permission

### Methods

- set_permission
- create_set_permission_signature
- set_all_permissions

### set_permission

Sets the permission for a specific function call.

Each policy is represented as a mapping from an IP account address to a signer address to a recipient
address to a function selector to a permission level. The permission level can be 0 (ABSTAIN), 1 (ALLOW), or
2 (DENY).

By default, all policies are set to 0 (ABSTAIN), which means that the permission is not set. The owner of IP Account by default has all permission.

| Method           |
| ---------------- |
| `set_permission` |

Parameters:

- `ip_id`: The IP ID that grants the permission for `signer`.
- `signer`: The address that can call `to` on behalf of the `ipAccount`.
- `to`: The address that can be called by the `signer` (currently only modules can be `to`)
- `permission`: The new permission level.
- `func`: [Optional] The function selector string of `to` that can be called by the `signer` on behalf of the `ipAccount`. By default, it allows all functions.
- `tx_options`: [Optional] Transaction options dictionary.

```python Python
set_permission_response = story_client.Permission.set_permission(
  ip_id="0x01",
  signer="0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  to="0x2345678901234567890123456789012345678901",
  permission=1,  # ALLOW
  func="0x12345678"  # Optional function selector
)
```

```python Request Parameters
ip_id: str  # The IP ID that grants the permission for signer
signer: str  # The address that can call to on behalf of the ipAccount
to: str  # The address that can be called by the signer (currently only modules can be to)
permission: int  # The new permission level (0=ABSTAIN, 1=ALLOW, 2=DENY)
func: str = "0x00000000"  # Optional: The function selector string
tx_options: dict = None  # Optional: Transaction options
```

```python Response
{
  "tx_hash": str  # The transaction hash
}
```

### create_set_permission_signature

Specific permission overrides wildcard permission with signature.

| Method                            |
| --------------------------------- |
| `create_set_permission_signature` |

Parameters:

- `ip_id`: The IP ID that grants the permission for `signer`.
- `signer`: The address that can call `to` on behalf of the `ipAccount`.
- `to`: The address that can be called by the `signer` (currently only modules can be `to`)
- `permission`: The new permission level.
- `func`: [Optional] The function selector string of `to` that can be called by the `signer` on behalf of the `ipAccount`. By default, it allows all functions.
- `deadline`: [Optional] The deadline for the signature in milliseconds, default is 1000ms.
- `tx_options`: [Optional] Transaction options dictionary.

```python Python
response = story_client.PermissionClient.create_set_permission_signature(
  ip_id="0x01",

  permission=1,  # ALLOW
  func="0x12345678",  # Optional function selector
  deadline=1000  # Optional deadline in milliseconds
)
```

```python Request Parameters

func: str = "0x00000000"  # Optional: The function selector string
deadline: int = None  # Optional: The deadline for the signature in milliseconds
tx_options: dict = None  # Optional: Transaction options
```

```python Response
{
  "tx_hash": str  # The transaction hash
}
```

### set_all_permissions

Sets permission to a signer for all functions across all modules.

| Method                |
| --------------------- |
| `set_all_permissions` |

Parameters:

- `ip_id`: The IP ID that grants the permission for `signer`.
- `signer`: The address of the signer receiving the permissions.
- `permission`: The new permission.
- `tx_options`: [Optional] Transaction options dictionary.

  signer="0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  permission=1  # ALLOW
)
```

```python Request Parameters
