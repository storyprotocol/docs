title: "IPAccountImpl"
---

The IPAccountImpl contract is Story's implementation of the IP Account, which follows the ERC-6551 standard for token-bound accounts. It provides functionality for IP assets to own and manage other assets, execute transactions, and interact with other contracts in a permissioned manner.

## State Variables

### ACCESS_CONTROLLER

```solidity
address public immutable ACCESS_CONTROLLER
```

The address of the AccessController contract used for permission checks. This is immutable and set during construction.

## Inheritance

IPAccountImpl inherits from:

- ERC6551: Base implementation of the ERC-6551 standard
- IPAccountStorage: Storage contract for IP Account data
- IIPAccount: Interface for IP Account functionality

### updateStateForValidSigner

```solidity
function updateStateForValidSigner(address signer, address to, bytes calldata data) external

```

Executes a transaction from the IP Account on behalf of the signer.

**Parameters:**

- `to`: The recipient of the transaction
- `value`: The amount of Ether to send
- `data`: The data to send along with the transaction
- `signer`: The signer of the transaction
- `deadline`: The deadline of the transaction signature

**Returns:**

- The return data from the transaction

### execute

```solidity
function execute(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external payable returns (bytes memory result)
```

Executes a transaction from the IP Account.

**Parameters:**

- `to`: The recipient of the transaction
- `value`: The amount of Ether to send
- `data`: The data to send along with the transaction

**Returns:**

- The return data from the transaction

### execute

```solidity
function execute(
    address to,
    uint256 value,
    bytes calldata data,
    uint8 operation
) public payable returns (bytes memory result)
```

Executes a transaction from the IP Account with a specified operation type.

**Parameters:**

- `to`: The recipient of the transaction
- `value`: The amount of Ether to send
- `data`: The data to send along with the transaction
- `operation`: The operation type to perform, only 0 - CALL is supported

### executeBatch

```solidity
function executeBatch(
    Call[] calldata calls,
    uint8 operation
) public payable returns (bytes[] memory results)
```

Executes a batch of transactions from the IP Account.

**Parameters:**

- `calls`: The array of calls to execute
- `operation`: The operation type to perform, only 0 - CALL is supported

**Returns:**

- The return data from the transactions

### isValidSignature

```solidity
function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes calldata signature) public view returns (bytes4 result)
```

ERC1271 signature verification is disabled for the IP Account.

**Parameters:**

- `hash`: The hash of the data to be signed
- `signature`: The signature to verify

## Events

### Executed

```solidity
event Executed(address to, uint256 value, bytes data, bytes32 state)
```

Emitted when a transaction is executed from the IP Account.

**Parameters:**

- `to`: The recipient of the transaction
- `value`: The amount of Ether sent
- `data`: The data sent along with the transaction
- `state`: The new state (nonce) of the account

### ExecutedWithSig

```solidity
event ExecutedWithSig(address to, uint256 value, bytes data, bytes32 state, uint256 deadline, address signer, bytes signature)
```

Emitted when a transaction is executed from the IP Account on behalf of a signer.

**Parameters:**

- `to`: The recipient of the transaction
- `value`: The amount of Ether sent
- `data`: The data sent along with the transaction
- `state`: The new state (nonce) of the account
- `deadline`: The deadline of the transaction signature
- `signer`: The signer of the transaction
- `signature`: The signature of the transaction

## Security Considerations

The IPAccountImpl contract implements several security measures:

1. **Permission System**: Uses an AccessController to manage permissions for different signers and operations.

2. **Signature Verification**: Implements EIP-712 typed data signing for secure transaction authorization.

3. **Deadline Checking**: Includes transaction deadlines to prevent replay attacks.

4. **Nonce Management**: Uses a state (nonce) system to prevent transaction replay.

5. **Input Validation**: Validates inputs and checks for edge cases, such as preventing invalid operations.

6. **Signature Malleability Protection**: Includes protections against signature malleability attacks.

7. **Limited Operations**: Only supports the CALL operation (0) for security reasons, restricting potentially dangerous operations.

8. **Upgradability Disabled**: The contract disables UUPS upgradability to ensure contract immutability.

## Usage Examples

### Executing a Transaction

An IP asset owner can execute a transaction through their IP Account:

```solidity
// Assuming 'ipAccount' is an instance of IPAccountImpl
ipAccount.execute(
    targetContract,
    0, // No ETH sent
    abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction(uint256)", 123)
);
```

### Executing with a Signature

A permitted signer can execute a transaction on behalf of the IP Account:

```solidity
// Generate signature off-chain
bytes signature = signEIP712Message(...);

// Execute transaction
ipAccount.executeWithSig(
    targetContract,
    0, // No ETH sent
    abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction(uint256)", 123),
    signer,
    deadline,
    signature
);
```
