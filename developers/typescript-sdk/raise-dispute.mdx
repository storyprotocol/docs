This section demonstrates how to dispute an IP on Story. There are many instances where you may want to dispute an IP - whether that IP is or is not owned by you. Disputing IP on Story is easy thanks to our [Dispute Module](/concepts/dispute-module) and the [UMA Arbitration Policy](/concepts/dispute-module/uma-arbitration-policy).

Let's say you register a drawing, and then someone else registers that drawing with 1 pixel off. You can dispute it along a `IMPROPER_REGISTRATION` tag, which communicates potential plagiarism.

In this tutorial, you will simply learn how to flag an IP as being disputed.

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)
2. Have a basic understanding of the [Dispute Module](/concepts/dispute-module)

## 1. Dispute an IP

To dispute an IP Asset, you will need:

- The `targetIpId` of the IP Asset you are disputing (we use a test one below)
- The `targetTag` that you are applying to the dispute. Only [whitelisted tags](/concepts/dispute-module/overview#dispute-tags) can be applied.
- A `cid` (Content Identifier) is a unique identifier in IPFS that represents the dispute evidence you must provide, as described [here](/concepts/dispute-module/uma-arbitration-policy#dispute-evidence-submission-guidelines) (we use a test one below).

<Warning>
  **Note you can only provide a CID one time.** After it is used, it can't be
  used as evidence again.
</Warning>

Create a `main.ts` file and add the code below:

```typescript main.ts
import { client } from "./utils";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { DisputeTargetTag } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

async function main() {
  const disputeResponse = await client.dispute.raiseDispute({
    targetIpId: "0x6b42d065aDCDA6fA83B59ad731841360dC5321fB",
    // NOTE: you must use your own CID here, because every time it is used,
    // the protocol does not allow you to use it again
    cid: "QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR",
    // you must pick from one of the whitelisted tags here: https://docs.story.foundation/concepts/dispute-module#dispute-tags
    targetTag: DisputeTargetTag.IMPROPER_REGISTRATION,
    bond: parseEther("0.1"), // minimum of 0.1
    liveness: 2592000,
  });
  console.log(
    `Dispute raised at transaction hash ${disputeResponse.txHash}, Dispute ID: ${disputeResponse.disputeId}`
  );
}

main();
```
