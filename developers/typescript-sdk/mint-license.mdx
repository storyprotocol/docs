title: Mint a License Token
description: Learn how to mint a License Token from an IP Asset in TypeScript.
---

This section demonstrates how to mint a [License Token](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) from an [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset). You can only mint a License Token from an IP Asset if the IP Asset has [License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms) attached to it. A License Token is minted as an ERC-721.

There are two reasons you'd mint a License Token:

1. To hold the license and be able to use the underlying IP Asset as the license described (for ex. "Can use commercially as long as you provide proper attribution and share 5% of your revenue)
2. Use the license token to link another IP Asset as a derivative of it. _Note though that, as you'll see later, some SDK functions don't require you to explicitly mint a license token first in order to register a derivative, and will actually handle it for you behind the scenes._

### Prerequisites

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. Complete the [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)
2. An IP Asset that has License Terms added. Learn how to add License Terms to an IPA [here](/developers/typescript-sdk/attach-terms).

## 1. Mint License

Let's say that IP Asset (`ipId = 0x01`) has License Terms (`licenseTermdId = 10`) attached to it. We want to mint 2 License Tokens with those terms to a specific wallet address (`0x02`).

<Warning>

Be mindful that some IP Assets may have license terms attached that require the user minting the license to pay a `defaultMintingFee`. You can see an example of that in the [TypeScript Tutorial](https://github.com/storyprotocol/typescript-tutorial/blob/main/scripts/derivative/registerDerivativeCommercialCustom.ts).

</Warning>

<Note>
 
  Note that a license token can only be minted if the `licenseTermsId` are already attached to the IP Asset, making it a publicly available license. The IP owner can, however, mint a [private license](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token#private-licenses) by minting a license token with a `licenseTermsId` that is not attached to the IP Asset.

</Note>

```typescript main.ts
// you should already have a client set up (prerequisite)
import { client } from "./client";

async function main() {
  const response = await client.license.mintLicenseTokens({
    licenseTermsId: "10",
    licensorIpId: "0x641E638e8FCA4d4844F509630B34c9D524d40BE5",
    receiver: "0x641E638e8FCA4d4844F509630B34c9D524d40BE5", // optional. if not provided, it will go to the tx sender
    amount: 2,
    maxMintingFee: BigInt(0), // disabled
    maxRevenueShare: 100, // default
    txOptions: { waitForTransaction: true },
  });

  console.log(
    `License Token minted at transaction hash ${response.txHash}, License IDs: ${response.licenseTokenIds}`
  );
}

main();
```

### 1a. Setting Restrictions on Minting License Token

This is a note for owners of an IP Asset who want to set restrictions on who or how their license tokens are minted. You can:

- Set a max number of licenses that can be minted
- Charge dynamic fees based on who / how many are minted
- Whitelisted certain wallets to mint the tokens

... and more. Learn more by checking out the [License Config](/concepts/licensing-module/license-config) section of our documentation.

## 2. Register a Derivative

Now that we have minted a License Token, we can hold it or use it to link an IP Asset as a derivative. We will go over that on the next page.

_Note though that, as you'll see later, some SDK functions don't require you to explicitly mint a license token first in order to register a derivative, and will actually handle it for you behind the scenes._

### 2a. Why would I ever use a License Token if it's not needed?

There are a few times when **you would need** a License Token to register a derivative:

- The License Token contains private license terms, so you would only be able to register as a derivative if you had the License Token that was manually minted by the owner. More on that [here](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token#private-licenses).
- The License Token (which is an NFT) costs a `mintingFee` to mint, and you were able to buy it on a marketplace for a cheaper price. Then it makes more sense to simply register with the License Token then have to pay the more expensive `defaultMintingFee`.
