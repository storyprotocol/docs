In this tutorial, you will learn how to send money ("tip") an IP Asset using the TypeScript SDK.

## The Explanation

In this scenario, let's say there is a parent IP Asset that represents Mickey Mouse. Someone else draws a hat on that Mickey Mouse and registers it as a derivative (or "child") IP Asset. The License Terms specify that the child must share 50% of all commercial revenue (`commercialRevShare = 50`) with the parent. Someone else (a 3rd party user) comes along and wants to send the derivative 2 \$WIP for being really cool.

For the purposes of this example, we will assume the child is already registered as a derivative IP Asset. If you want help learning this, check out [Register a Derivative](/developers/typescript-sdk/register-derivative).

- Parent IP ID: `0x42595dA29B541770D9F9f298a014bF912655E183`
- Child IP ID: `0xeaa4Eed346373805B377F5a4fe1daeFeFB3D182a`

## 0. Before you Start

There are a few steps you have to complete before you can start the tutorial.

1. You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). If you've coded before, you likely have these.
2. Add your Story Network Testnet wallet's private key to `.env` file:

```text env
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

3. Add your preferred RPC URL to your `.env` file. You can just use the public default one we provide:

```text env
RPC_PROVIDER_URL=https://aeneid.storyrpc.io
```

4. Install the dependencies:

```bash Terminal
npm install @story-protocol/core-sdk viem
```

## 1. Set up your Story Config

In a `utils.ts` file, add the following code to set up your Story Config:

- Associated docs: [TypeScript SDK Setup](/developers/typescript-sdk/setup)

```typescript utils.ts
import { StoryClient, StoryConfig } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";
import { http } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount, Address, Account } from "viem/accounts";

const privateKey: Address = `0x${process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY}`;
export const account: Account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

const config: StoryConfig = {
  account: account,
  transport: http(process.env.RPC_PROVIDER_URL),
  chainId: "aeneid",
};
export const client = StoryClient.newClient(config);
```

## 2. Tipping the Derivative IP Asset

Now create a `main.ts` file. We will use the `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function to pay the derivative asset.

You will be paying the IP Asset with [\$WIP](https://aeneid.storyscan.io/address/0x1514000000000000000000000000000000000000). **Note that if you don't have enough \$WIP, the function will auto wrap an equivalent amount of \$IP into \$WIP for you.** If you don't have enough of either, it will fail.

<Note>
**Whitelisted Revenue Tokens**

Only tokens that are whitelisted by our protocol can be used as payment ("revenue") tokens. \$WIP is one of those tokens. To see that list, go [here](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts).

</Note>

Now we can call the `payRoyaltyOnBehalf` function. In this case:

1. `receiverIpId` is the `ipId` of the derivative (child) asset
2. `payerIpId` is `zeroAddress` because the payer is a 3rd party (someone that thinks Mickey Mouse with a hat on him is cool), and not necessarily another IP Asset
3. `token` is the address of \$WIP, which can be found [here](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)
4. `amount` is 2, since the person tipping wants to send 2 \$WIP

```typescript main.ts
import { client } from "./utils";
import { zeroAddress, parseEther } from "viem";
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

async function main() {
  const response = await client.royalty.payRoyaltyOnBehalf({
    receiverIpId: "0xeaa4Eed346373805B377F5a4fe1daeFeFB3D182a",
    payerIpId: zeroAddress,
    token: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    amount: parseEther("2"), // 2 $WIP
  });
  console.log(`Paid royalty at transaction hash ${response.txHash}`);
}

main();
```

## 3. Child Claiming Due Revenue

At this point we have already finished the tutorial: we learned how to tip an IP Asset. But what if the child and parent want to claim their due revenue?

The child has been paid 2 \$WIP. But remember, it shares 50% of its revenue with the parent IP because of the `commercialRevenue = 50` in the license terms.

The child IP can claim its 1 \$WIP by calling the `claimAllRevenue` function:

- `ancestorIpId` is the `ipId` we're claiming revenue for
- `currencyTokens` is an array that contains the address of \$WIP, which can be found [here](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)
- `claimer` is the address that holds the [royalty tokens](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault#royalty-tokens) associated with the child's [IP Royalty Vault](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault). By default, they are in the IP Account, which is just the `ipId` of the child asset.

```typescript main.ts
import { client } from "./utils";
import { zeroAddress, parseEther } from "viem";
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...
  const response = await client.royalty.claimAllRevenue({
    ancestorIpId: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2",
    claimer: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2",
    currencyTokens: [WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS],
    childIpIds: [],
    royaltyPolicies: [],
  });

  console.log(`Claimed revenue: ${response.claimedTokens}`);
}

main();
```

<Accordion title="Where does revenue get claimed to? Why is it in the IP Account?" icon="face-thinking">

A couple of things to note here:

1. By default, revenue is claimed to the IP Account, not the IP owner's
   wallet. This is because when an IP is created, the royalty tokens for that IP
   (where revenue gets claimed to) are minted to the IP Account.

2. To transfer revenue from IP Account -> IP Owner's wallet, the owners of the
   parent and child IP can run the `transferErc20` function (it will not work
   if you run it for someone else's IP obviously).

   ```typescript main.ts
   // Docs: https://docs.story.foundation/sdk-reference/ipaccount#transfererc20
   const transferFromIpAccount = await client.ipAccount.transferErc20({
     ipId: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2",
     tokens: [
       {
         address: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
         amount: parseEther("1"),
         target: "0x02", // the external wallet
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

3. If the **IP owner** (the wallet that owns the underlying IP ownership NFT) had
   called `claimAllRevenue` before, our SDK would automatically transfer the revenue
   to the IP owner's wallet for convenience.

4. If the IP owner wants revenue to always be claimed to their wallet and
   avoid the middle step, they should transfer the royalty tokens from the IP
   account to their wallet.

   ```typescript main.ts
   // Get the IP Royalty Vault Address
   // Note: This is equivalent to the currency address of the ERC-20
   // Royalty Tokens for this IP.
   const royaltyVaultAddress = await client.royalty.getRoyaltyVaultAddress(
     "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2" as Address
   );

   // Transfer the Royalty Tokens from the IP Account to the address
   // executing this transaction (you could use any other address as well)
   const transferRoyaltyTokens = await client.ipAccount.transferErc20({
     ipId: "0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2" as Address,
     tokens: [
       {
         address: royaltyVaultAddress,
         amount: 1 * 1_000_000, // 1% of the royalty tokens
         target: "0x02", // the external wallet
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

</Accordion>

## 4. Parent Claiming Due Revenue

Continuing, the parent should be able to claim its revenue as well. In this example, the parent should be able to claim 1 \$WIP since the child earned 2 \$WIP and the `commercialRevShare = 50` in the license terms.

We will use the `claimAllRevenue` function to claim the due revenue tokens.

1. `ancestorIpId` is the `ipId` of the parent ("ancestor") asset
2. `claimer` is the address that holds the royalty tokens associated with the parent's [IP Royalty Vault](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault). By default, they are in the IP Account, which is just the `ipId` of the parent asset
3. `childIpIds` will have the `ipId` of the child asset
4. `royaltyPolicies` will contain the address of the royalty policy. As explained in [Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module), this is either `RoyaltyPolicyLAP` or `RoyaltyPolicyLRP`, depending on the license terms. In this case, let's assume the license terms specify a `RoyaltyPolicyLAP`. Simply go to [Deployed Smart Contracts](/developers/deployed-smart-contracts) and find the correct address.
5. `currencyTokens` is an array that contains the address of \$WIP, which can be found [here](/concepts/royalty-module/ip-royalty-vault#whitelisted-revenue-tokens)

```typescript main.ts
import { client } from "./utils";
import { zeroAddress, parseEther } from "viem";
import { WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "@story-protocol/core-sdk";

async function main() {
  // previous code here ...

  const response = await client.royalty.claimAllRevenue({
    ancestorIpId: "0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384",
    claimer: "0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384",
    currencyTokens: [WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS],
    childIpIds: ["0xDa03c4B278AD44f5a669e9b73580F91AeDE0E3B2"],
    royaltyPolicies: ["0xBe54FB168b3c982b7AaE60dB6CF75Bd8447b390E"],
  });

  console.log(`Claimed revenue: ${response.claimedTokens}`);
}

main();
```

<Accordion title="Where does revenue get claimed to? Why is it in the IP Account?" icon="face-thinking">

Exactly the same as the child, there are a few things to note here:

1. By default, revenue is claimed to the IP Account, not the IP owner's
   wallet. This is because when an IP is created, the royalty tokens for that IP
   (where revenue gets claimed to) are minted to the IP Account.

2. To transfer revenue from IP Account -> IP Owner's wallet, the owners of the
   parent and child IP can run the `transferErc20` function (it will not work
   if you run it for someone else's IP obviously).

   ```typescript main.ts
   // Docs: https://docs.story.foundation/sdk-reference/ipaccount#transfererc20
   const transferFromIpAccount = await client.ipAccount.transferErc20({
     ipId: "0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384",
     tokens: [
       {
         address: WIP_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
         amount: parseEther("1"),
         target: "0x02", // the external wallet
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

3. If the **IP owner** (the wallet that owns the underlying IP ownership NFT) had
   called `claimAllRevenue` before, our SDK would automatically transfer the revenue
   to the IP owner's wallet for convenience.

4. If the IP owner wants revenue to always be claimed to their wallet and
   avoid the middle step, they should transfer the royalty tokens from the IP
   account to their wallet.

   ```typescript main.ts
   // Get the IP Royalty Vault Address
   // Note: This is equivalent to the currency address of the ERC-20
   // Royalty Tokens for this IP.
   const royaltyVaultAddress = await client.royalty.getRoyaltyVaultAddress(
     "0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384" as Address
   );

   // Transfer the Royalty Tokens from the IP Account to the address
   // executing this transaction (you could use any other address as well)
   const transferRoyaltyTokens = await client.ipAccount.transferErc20({
     ipId: "0x089d75C9b7E441dA3115AF93FF9A855BDdbfe384" as Address,
     tokens: [
       {
         address: royaltyVaultAddress,
         amount: 1 * 1_000_000, // 1% of the royalty tokens
         target: "0x03", // the external wallet
       },
     ],
   });
   ```
