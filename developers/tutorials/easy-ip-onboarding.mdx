This tutorial will show you how to integrate purchasing $IP with Apple Pay, Venmo, Debit Card, Bank, and more into your DApp with Halliday.

<Note>

**This tutorial is a React/Next.js tutorial**. It is also based on the [Halliday Docs](https://docs.halliday.xyz/pages/index-page).

</Note>

Here is what the end result will look like:

## Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an API Key">

In order to use Halliday, you will need to get an API key. Right now the process is to email partnerships@halliday.xyz. But this may change, so I recommend checking the [Halliday Docs](https://docs.halliday.xyz/pages/payments-hello-world) for the most up to date information.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Halliday">

Next, install the Halliday Payments SDK in the root folder of your project.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @halliday-sdk/payments
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @halliday-sdk/payments
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup Your .env">

In your `.env` file, add your Halliday API key.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_HALLIDAY_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate Halliday">

Lastly, integrate Halliday Payments into your existing application with a few lines of code.

<Note>

In this example, we make it so that the Halliday popup is embedded in a div with the id `halliday-embed`. Such that when the user loads the page, it is already there. However you can change this so that it pops up when the user clicks a button. Check out the [Halliday Docs](https://docs.halliday.xyz/pages/payments-widget) for more information.

</Note>

```tsx
"use client";
import { openHallidayPayments } from "@halliday-sdk/payments";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  useEffect(() => {
    openHallidayPayments({
      apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HALLIDAY_PUBLIC_API_KEY as string,
      // $IP on Story
      outputs: ["story:0x"],
      // $USDC.e on Story
      // outputs: ["story:0xf1815bd50389c46847f0bda824ec8da914045d14"],
      sandbox: false,
      windowType: "EMBED",
      targetElementId: "halliday-embed",
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div
      className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-white"
      id="halliday-embed"
    ></div>
  );
}
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! You can now use Halliday to purchase $IP on Story.
