title: License Terms
description: A particular combination of values from a License Template that define how others can interact with your IP
---

When registering your IP on Story, you can attach License Terms to the IP. These are real, legally binding terms enforced on-chain by the [üìú Licensing Module](/concepts/licensing-module/overview), disputable by the [‚ùå Dispute Module](/concepts/dispute-module/overview), and in the worst case, able to be enforced off-chain in court through traditional means.

In them are also terms for commercial usage, which describes how the [üí∏ Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module/overview) will be enforced (ex. "50% of revenue must be shared with the parent IP").

More specifically, License Terms are a particular combination of values from a [License Template](/concepts/licensing-module/license-template). Indeed, there can and will exist **multiple** License Terms (variations) for each License Template. You can imagine that a License Template generates many License Term variations.

Once registered, **License Terms are immutable ‚Äî they can't be tampered with or altered**, even by the License Template that generated it.

Additionally, License Terms have a unique numeric ID within the License Template they stem from. This makes License Terms reusable, meaning if someone creates License Terms with a specific set of values, it only needs to be created once and can be used by anyone else.

For example, a particular set of term values of the [Programmable IP License (PILüíä)](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/overview), such as non-commercial usage + derivatives allowed + free minting, defines a unique License Terms with an associated ID.

## License Terms Attached to IP Asset

The owner of a root IP Asset can attach License Terms to signal to other users that they can mint License Tokens of those terms to create a derivative of this IP Asset. **Once License Terms are attached to an IP Asset, it is now considered "public" and anyone can mint a License Token using those terms.**

## Inherited License Terms

On the other hand, derivative IP Assets inherit their License Terms from the parent IP Asset. This means that when an IP Asset registers itself as a derivative, it burns the License Token and inherits the associated License Terms. **The owner of this derivative cannot set new License Terms.**

<Note>

You may be wondering: "if I cannot set new License Terms on my derivative, does that also mean I can't change the minting fee, or disallowing more derivatives, on my derivative?"

Thankfully, there is a way to get around this! Although you cannot change License Terms on a derivative IP, you can utilize the [License Config to implement special behaviors](/concepts/licensing-module/license-config).

</Note>

## Expiration

License Terms support an `expiration` time. Once License Terms expire, any derivatives that abide by that license will no longer be able to generate revenue or create further derivatives. If an IP Asset is a derivative of multiple parents, it will expire when the soonest expiration time between the two parents is reached.
