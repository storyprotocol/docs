The Licensing Module allows you to create a real legal license from a **License Template** (which is the [Programmable IP License (PILðŸ’Š)](/concepts/programmable-ip-license/overview)) and attach it to your IP Asset. This license, and the **License Terms** that define it, restrict how others can use your IP, commercialize it, and remix it.

If License Terms are attached to an IP Asset, anyone can mint a **License Token** (an ERC-721 NFT) from it which acts as the license to use that work based on the terms that define it. This token can then be burned to register a derivative work. This then establishes a parent-child relationship between assets, unlocking things like automatic royalty flow from the [ðŸ’¸ Royalty Module](/concepts/royalty-module/overview).

</Accordion>

The owner of an IP Asset owns intellectual property rights such as creating derivatives, being commercially exploited, and being reproduced in different platforms.

IP Assets can programmatically grant permissions for any users to exercise those rights with some autonomy via [License Tokens](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) (an ERC-721 NFT), which point to a particular set of conditions, known as [License Terms](/concepts/licensing-module/license-terms).
