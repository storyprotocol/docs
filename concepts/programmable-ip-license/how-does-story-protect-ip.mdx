<Tip>Every license created on Story is a real, enforceable legal contract.</Tip>

## The Programmable IP License (PIL): The Foundation of Legal Enforcement

At its core, every [IP Asset](/concepts/ip-asset) registered on Story is wrapped by a **legally binding document called the [Programmable IP License (PIL)](/concepts/programmable-ip-license)**. Based on US copyright law, the PIL acts as a universal license agreement template that allows IP owners to attach customizable terms to their assets.

**Licensing on Story means making a genuine legal commitment.** The parameters defined in the PIL—commercial use, derivative allowances, attribution requirements, and royalty structures—represent legally enforceable terms between the IP owner (licensor) and anyone who licenses the IP (licensee).

### How does the PIL enable enforcement?

- **Clear Legal Terms:** The PIL provides a standardized way for IP owners to define usage rules.
- **On-Chain Record as Evidence:** PIL terms attached to an IP Asset are recorded immutably on Story's purpose-built blockchain, serving as _irrefutable evidence_ of the agreed-upon terms.
- **Off-Chain Legal Recourse:** If IP is misused in violation of PIL terms, the IP owner can leverage on-chain evidence in **off-chain legal proceedings** such as arbitration or court actions.
- **License Tokens as Proof of Rights:** Licensees receive a [**License Token**](/concepts/licensing-module/license-token) (NFT) representing specific usage rights granted under the PIL terms, providing further evidence of authorization status.

## The Story Attestation Service (SAS): Proactive Infringement Monitoring

Beyond the legal framework, we are building the [**Story Attestation Service (SAS)**](/concepts/story-attestation-service) to help IP owners monitor for potential copyright infringement using a multi-layered decentralized approach.

<Note>
  SAS is a signal layer, not a judgment layer—it flags potential issues for the
  IP owner to act upon, rather than taking automated enforcement actions.
</Note>

### How the SAS Helps with Infringement Detection:

- **Network of Specialized Providers:** SAS coordinates with service providers like Yakoa and Pex that use AI and machine learning to detect copyright violations across different media types on the internet and other blockchains.
- **Transparent Signals:** SAS provides publicly accessible signals regarding the legitimacy of an IP Asset based on provider findings.
- **Focus on Commercial IP:** Currently, SAS primarily runs infringement checks on commercial IP Assets—those with at least one License Terms where `commercialUse = true`.
- **Metadata-Driven Checks:** SAS relies on IP-specific metadata provided during registration to perform checks against existing online content.

### Important Considerations:

- **Detection, Not Prevention:** SAS primarily flags potential infringements after IP registration rather than preventing them.
- **Internet-Based Checks:** Currently, SAS primarily detects infringement based on content already existing online, not offline uses.
- **No Guarantee of Perfection:** No system can guarantee 100% detection of all copyright infringement.

## The Role of the Dispute Module

We have also built a [**Dispute Module**](/concepts/dispute-module) that allows anyone to raise on-chain disputes against IP Assets for reasons such as improper registration or potential plagiarism. This can lead to on-chain flagging of disputed IP, potentially affecting its ability to generate licenses or earn revenue.

## The Hybrid Enforcement Model

<Note>
  Story doesn't replace courts or lawyers—it gives IP holders tools that work
  with traditional enforcement systems while benefiting from on-chain
  automation, transparency, and interoperability.
</Note>

### What Story Can Do:

- Provide a legally sound framework for IP licensing through the PIL
- Create an immutable on-chain record of IP ownership and license terms
- Offer monitoring tools through the SAS to detect potential online infringement
- Facilitate on-chain dispute resolution through the Dispute Module
- Provide evidence usable for off-chain legal enforcement

### What Story Cannot Do:

- Act as a global police force for IP infringement
- Guarantee prevention of all unauthorized IP uses
- Directly enforce legal judgments in the physical world
- Monitor every digital and physical interaction with registered IP
