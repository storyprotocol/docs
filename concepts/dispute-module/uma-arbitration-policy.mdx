</Note>

This arbitration policy is a dispute resolution mechanism that uses UMA’s optimistic oracle to verify disputes. Below we share a high-level overview of how the UMA dispute process works.

## Smart Contract Flow Diagram

1. Raise Dispute - The first step to initiate a dispute against an IP Asset is to call the `raiseDispute` function on [DisputeModule.sol](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-core-v1/blob/main/contracts/modules/dispute/DisputeModule.sol). This function will in turn call `assertTruth` on UMA's `OptimisticOracleV3.sol`. To initiate a dispute the dispute initiator will need to post a bond of at least the minimum bond defined by UMA for the selected currency. Note that this bond will be lost if the dispute is deemed not verifiably correct by the oracle.

   After this step, the dispute will be “open” to be countered/appealed by other users. If there is no counter/appeal, UMA rules define that the IP will be considered to be infringing.

   ```sol DisputeModule.sol
   /// @notice Raises a dispute on a given ipId
   /// @param targetIpId The ipId that is the target of the dispute
   /// @param disputeEvidenceHash The hash pointing to the dispute evidence - this could be an IPFS CID 				converted to a bytes32 hash. This is the document with the proof that UMA reviewers will potentially read
   /// @param targetTag The target tag of the dispute
   /// @param data The data to initialize the policy - here you can do abi.encode of liveness, token address 	and bond amount
   /// @return disputeId The id of the newly raised dispute
   function raiseDispute(
    address targetIpId,
    bytes32 disputeEvidenceHash,
    bytes32 targetTag,
    bytes calldata data
   ) external returns (uint256 disputeId);
   ```

2. (Optional) Dispute Assertion / Counter Dispute / Make Appeal - After the `raiseDispute` call there is a period of time called "liveness" in which a counter dispute/appeal can be submitted. The liveness period is split in two parts: (i) the first part of the liveness period in which only the IP owner can counter dispute/appeal and (ii) a second part in which any address can counter dispute/appeal - which can be done by calling `disputeAssertion` on `ArbitrationPolicyUMA.sol`. To counter a dispute the caller will need to post a bond of the same amount and currency that was used by the dispute initiator when raising a dispute. Note that this bond will be lost if the original dispute is deemed to be verifiably correct by the oracle.

   After this step, the dispute is escalated and will be reviewed by external party UMA.

   ```sol ArbitrationPolicyUMA.sol
    /// @notice Allows the IP that was targeted with a dispute to dispute the assertion while providing counter evidence
    /// @param assertionId The identifier of the assertion that was disputed
    /// @param counterEvidenceHash The hash of the counter evidence
    function disputeAssertion(bytes32 assertionId, bytes32 counterEvidenceHash) external;

    /// @notice Returns the assertion id for a given dispute id
    /// @param disputeId The dispute id
    function disputeIdToAssertionId(uint256 disputeId) external view returns (bytes32);
   ```

3. (If step 2 happened) UMA reviewers judge the dispute. On this step the user just has to wait until the UMA reviewers make the dispute judgement. This step could take 48-96 hours.
4. Settle Assertion - This step is expected to be automatic as UMA runs a bot that calls `settleAssertion` which in turn distributes the bonds back to the address that wins the dispute.
   1. If nobody submitted a counter dispute then when the liveness period is over, any address can call `settleAssertion` on UMA's `OptimisticOracleV3.sol`.
   2. If somebody has submitted a counter dispute/appeal before the liveness period is over, then the dispute is escalated to UMA reviewers who will judge and make a decision on whether the IP is infringing or not. After the decision has been made, then any address can call `settleAssertion` on UMA's `OptimisticOracleV3.sol`.

## Dispute Evidence Submission Guidelines

When raising a dispute or making a counter dispute, both parties can submit dispute evidence. Dispute evidence refers to a text document that oracle participants will use & read from to make a judgement on the dispute.

### Burden of Proof

In all disputes with UMA arbitration policy, the burden of proof lies with the party creating the dispute. This means that the disputer must provide clear, compelling, and verifiable evidence to prove the dispute beyond reasonable doubt. Disputes that do not meet this high bar can be counter-disputed with the disputing party losing their bond.

### Document Characteristics

<Warning>

As the process is still experimental, we can expect iteration and fine-tuning on the contents/formats of how the evidence should be submitted.

</Warning>

Every document should have the following characteristics:

- It should be a text document. Can have images or video if necessary.

- It should be uploaded on IPFS.

- It should not take the reviewer more than 1 hour to review the dispute evidence document - the reviewer's time is limited and the evidence could be deemed invalid if it would take too much time to review. Best efforts will be applied to solve a dispute but please keep it concise to have your dispute evidence be valid.

Depending on what the type of the Dispute Tag is, you also need to include in the evidence the "Dispute Evidence Contents of the table below:
