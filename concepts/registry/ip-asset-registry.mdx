The IP Asset Registry is responsible for registering IPs into the protocol. It deploys a dedicated [IP Account](/concepts/ip-asset/ip-account) contract for each new IP Asset registered on the protocol (_NOTE: This registry inherits from the_ [IP Account Registry](https://github.com/storyprotocol/protocol-core-v1/blob/main/contracts/registries/IPAccountRegistry.sol))

### Notable Functions

```solidity IPAssetRegistry.sol
function register(uint256 chainid, address tokenContract, uint256 tokenId) external whenNotPaused returns (address id)
```

This function registers an ERC-721 NFT as a new IP Asset on Story.
