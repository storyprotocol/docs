description: Learn about the various registries that maintain the global state of the Story Protocol
---

The various registries on Story function as a primary directory/storage for the global states of the protocol. Obviously, they also contain functions to update that storage.

Unlike [⚙️ IP Accounts](/concepts/ip-asset/ip-account), which manage the state of specific IPs, a **registry** oversees the broader states of the protocol.

# Types of Registries

Below are all of the registries on Story.

## [IP Asset Registry](/concepts/registry/ip-asset-registry)

Responsible for registering IPs into the protocol.

## [Group IP Asset Registry](/concepts/registry/group-ip-asset-registry)

Responsible for registering and maintaining Group IP Assets.

## [License Registry](/concepts/registry/license-registry)

Stores all license-related states within the protocol, like attaching License Terms to IP Assets, registering derivatives, creating new License Templates, etc.

## [Module Registry](/concepts/registry/module-registry)

Maintains and updates the global list of modules and hooks registered permissionlessly on Story
