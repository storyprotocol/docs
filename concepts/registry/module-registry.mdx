The Module Registry maintains and updates the global list of modules and hooks registered permissionlessly on Story. It can enable/disable modules on a per-IP Account basis for granular control over each IP Account's interaction with modules and hooks.

**This module is likely not very important for you** unless you wish to dive into creating/reading modules.
