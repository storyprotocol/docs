The Foundation may directly or indirectly purchase and sell Story tokens ($IP) at any time and
from time to time in its sole discretion for any reason and it has previously engaged in such
purchase and sale transactions. Such purchases and sales may be made through open market
transactions, OTC trades, block trades, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means.
The Foundation may also, from time to time, enter into programmatic sales and/or purchase
plans with respect to the sale and/or purchase of Story tokens. The volume, price, timing and
manner of any sales and purchases and other parameters will be determined by the Foundation in
its sole discretion. These transactions may involve the Foundation selling Story tokens at a price
(or at an average price) that is greater than the price (or the average price) at which the
Foundation purchases Story tokens in close proximity to one another or over time. This notice
does not obligate the Foundation to sell or purchase any specific amount of Story tokens or
within any specific time period and, if any such purchases or sales are commenced, may be
modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice at the discretion of the
Foundation. **The Foundation will enter into such transactions on a proprietary basis for its own
benefit and account and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not enter into any such transactions as
agent or otherwise on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any other person.**
