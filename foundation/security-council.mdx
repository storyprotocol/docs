A Security Council is an independent, semi-centralized group of trusted individuals or entities empowered to act swiftly to protect a decentralized protocol during emergencies. While decentralization is the ultimate goal of Story, the council provides a pragmatic layer of operational security that can mitigate risks that decentralized governance cannot quickly address.

### üõ°Ô∏è¬†Purpose and Core Responsibilities

The Security Council‚Äôs primary role is to safeguard the integrity of the Story Network and Story Protocol through technical oversight, by

- Proposing parameter adjustments to the protocol and network.
- Veto network upgrade or parameter changes
- Monitoring and alerting for:
  - Critical vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
  - Monitor and alert for ongoing exploits draining user funds.
  - Monitor and alert for compromised admin keys or governance mechanisms.
  - Malicious governance or upgrade proposals.
- Reviewing improvement proposals and alerting of harmful security or economic side effects.

## ü™Ñ¬†Council powers

### **Emergency Actions**

The Council has authority to take critical actions immediately, without delay, in the case of security emergencies (e.g., exploits or vulnerabilities that threaten network integrity).

- Pause or freeze contracts using privileged functions.
- Revoke or change access to admin keys or contracts.
- Schedule upgrades, patches and parameter changes before full DAO approval.
- Restore funds in coordination with governance, if feasible.

> Transparency requirement: After any Emergency Action, a full transparency report must be issued as soon as it is safe to disclose what was done and why.

### ‚òëÔ∏è¬†**Non-Emergency Actions**

In non-emergency scenarios, the Council can:

- Integration with Story Improvement Process (SIP)
  - Reviewing proposals (e.g., SIPs, forks, smart contract upgrades).
  - Writing SIPs
  - Issuing technical recommendations
- Review SIPs for technical feasibility
- Verify that \*\*\*\*DAO vote‚Äôs result in executed onchain outcomes
- Propose adjusting protocol parameters like:
  - Protocol fees.
  - Validator staking amounts and commission rates.
  - Reserve rates for the $IP token pool.
- Propose cancellation or roll back scheduled upgrades.

Beyond emergency responses, the council may:

- **Participate in code reviews** and smart contract audits.
- **Maintain a risk register** to track known threats.
- **Respond to bug bounty reports** alongside core developers and audit firms.
- **Coordinate with white-hat hackers** during disclosures.

Their goal here is **preventative security**, not just reactive defense.

## ü§ùMeetings

Regular meetings

- Will be held bi-weekly with the focus of reviewing and establishing the governance process and upgrade execution setup. Frequency might be adjusted later on.
- Example of topics
  - Review of SIPs
  - Review of previous changes and scheduled upgrades
  - Evaluation of security reports or incidents
  - Synching with Foundation or other stakeholders
- Meetings will be minuted for transparency, with a report being published after.

Emergency meetings

- Security council members will be on-call for ad-hoc, immediate meetings convened when any critical issue arises (e.g. security breach, discovered vulnerability, exploit in progress).
- They will be confidential until public disclosure is safe
